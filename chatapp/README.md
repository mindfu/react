### Installing

A few steps to get up and running.

Step 1: After installation of Node.js, install Webpack and Webpack Dev Server globally.

```
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

Step 2: CD to directory with 2 command line prompts. 

```
webpack-dev-server (On First command line.  Will start server on http://localhost:8080 )
node server (On second. Will start Socket io connection on http://localhost:3000 )

You will need both of these running with no errors to proceed.  Set browser to http://localhost:8080
